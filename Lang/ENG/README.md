## Code Example

```python
# Simple program to print "Hello, World!"
print("Hello, World!")
```

By just writing code using the syntax as shown above, you can print anything within the parentheses (). At the end of the code, there is no need to terminate it with a semicolon ;, as required in some other programming languages.
